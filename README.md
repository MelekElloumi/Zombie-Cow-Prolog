# Zombie Cow game with SWI-Prolog

- This is a grid-based game developped by logical progamming in SWI-Prolog.
- Consult `Zombie_Cow.pl` in SWI-Prolog then run the game with `jouer.`.
- You can configure the starting parameters in the first part of the code.

### Game Description

- You play as Dimitri "D" and you need to avoid the zombified cows for the longest number of turns.
- Each turn you write your command action then it shows the result grid.
- 3 types of cows (Uppercase letters) spawns randomly with only 1 zombie cow that can zombify other cows (lowercase letters) . They move in a random direction each turn.
- There are trees and rocks as obstacles.
- I took into account if the obstacles prevents dimitri from moving, so it always create a losable random configuration
